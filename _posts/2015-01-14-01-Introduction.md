Over the course of the next two days we are going to walk through a typical data analysis workflow in R.  This is the first lesson and we are going to focus on making sure everything is working and some basic orientation in R.  The real fun will start in the lessons to come.  

Our goals for this lesson are:

- Understand what R is and what it can be used for
- Why would you choose R over another tool
- Troubleshoot software installs (keep your fingers crossed)
- Gain familiarity with using R from within the RStudio IDE
- Get to know the basic syntax of R functions
- Be able to install and load a package into your R library
- Know how to get help
