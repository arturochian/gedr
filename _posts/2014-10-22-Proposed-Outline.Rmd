title: Proposed Outline For GED R Training
author: Jeffrey W. Hollister
---

This is likely to be a working outline and should change some as the discussions progress and the materials develop.  The workshop is designed around my own idea of what a common data analysis workflow would entail: get -> clean -> explore -> visualize -> analyze -> publish.  I hope this to be significantly more hands-on exercises and less show and tell.  After the workshop you won't be an expert but should have the foundation for getting started on your own data analysis work in R and will know where and how to get hlep.
