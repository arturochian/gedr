title: GED R Workshop Outline
author: Jeffrey W. Hollister

This is likely to be a working outline and should change some as the discussions progress and the materials develop.  The workshop is designed around my own idea of what a common data analysis workflow would entail: get -> clean -> explore -> visualize -> analyze.  

I hope this workshop to be more hands-on exercises and less show and tell.  After the workshop you won't be an expert but should have the foundation for getting started on your own data analysis work in R and will know where and how to get help. 

This outline and way of thinking about teaching R is greatly influenced by both [Software Carpentry](software-carpentry.org) and [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/).  I have borrowed a great deal of the materials from both places.

For each of the lessons there is a blog post that describes what we are doing, provides some examples and also provides some hands-on exercises.  I have written these as blog posts for use after the workshop.  Additionally, all of the code for each lesson is available as a stand alone R script.  During the workshop we will work mostly from the script.
