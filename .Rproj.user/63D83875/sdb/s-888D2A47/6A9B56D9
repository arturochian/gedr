Hollister\n---\n\nThis is likely to be a working outline and should change some as the discussions progress and the materials develop.  The workshop is designed around my own idea of what a common data analysis workflow would entail: get -> clean -> explore -> visualize -> analyze.  \n\nI hope this workshop to be more hands-on exercises and less show and tell.  After the workshop you won't be an expert but should have the foundation for getting started on your own data analysis work in R and will know where and how to get help. \n\nThis outline and way of thinking about teaching R is greatly influenced by both [Software Carpentry](software-carpentry.org) and [Data Carpentry](http://datacarpentry.org/).  I have borrowed a great deal of the materials from both places.\n\n- Introduction\n - Getting R and RStudio going\n - Using packages\n - Using functions\n - Help!\n- Get\n - Data types and structures in R\n - Reading data into R\n- Clean\n - Subset and Indexing\n - Reshaping and modifying data\n- Explore\n - Exploratory data analysis\n - Summary Statistics\n- Visualize\n - Base graphics\n - ggplot2\n- Analyze\n - Some \"more advanced\" statistics\n- Advanced Topics (time/interest dependent)\n - Programming with R\n - R as GIS\n - Reproducible Research\n - Creating your own packages\n ",
