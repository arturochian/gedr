Over the course of the next two days we are going to walk through a typical data analysis workflow in R.  This is the first lesson.  

Our goals for this lesson are:
- Understand what R is and what it can be used for
- Why would you choose R over another tool
- Troubleshoot software installs (keep your fingers crossed)
- Gain familiarity with using R from within the RStudio IDE
- Be able to install and load a package into your R library
- Get to know the basic syntax of R functions
