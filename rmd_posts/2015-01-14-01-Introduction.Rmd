Over the course of the next two days we are going to walk through a typical data analysis workflow in R.  But, with this first lesson we are going to focus on making sure everything is working and get some basic orientation in R.  The real fun will start in the lessons to come.  

Our goals for this lesson are:

- Understand what R is and what it can be used for
- Why would you choose R over another tool
- Troubleshoot software installs (keep your fingers crossed)
- Gain familiarity with using R from within the RStudio IDE
- Get to know the basic syntax of R functions
- Be able to install and load a package into your R library
- Know how to get help

##Quick Links to Excercises and R code
My goal is to have this workshop be as hands-on as possible.  As such, there are excercises through out.  For each lesson, I will provide a list of links near the top of the post so that you can skip all the prose and jump straight to the lessons.  So, here are the links for Lesson 1.

- [Lesson 1 R Code](rmd_posts/2015-01-14-01-Introduction.R): All the code from this post in an R Script.
- [Exercise 1](#exercise-1): RStudio Introduction.
- [Exercise 2](#exercise-2): Functions, packages, and help

##What is R and why use it
R is an open source language and environment for data analysis, statistics, and visualization.  This is the typical definition.  I would argue that R has evolved a bit and is now, more and more, also a general purpose computing language.  It is very widely used in academia and industry for statistics, visualization, data science, and general purpose computation.  In short, the answer to the question to, "Can you do that in R" is almost always yes.  R may not be the best answer, but it is an accurate one.  

The primary reason R is widely used is that it is free, has a large and vibrant community, it is easily extensible, and back to that question, yes you can do that in R!  More to the point, in the environmental sciences R is able to handle any data management, analysis or visualization task that you would need to accomplish and it has capabilities to provide a fully reproducible analysis. 

Lastly, R has almost become the standard for any data analysis or visualization task.  A great site [r4stats.com](http://r4stats.com) has an [article](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/) on data analysis software popularity that is kept update on the relative popularity of different languages.  One striking figure is the comparison of links to the main pages of the different languages:

![r4stats.com web site link graph](http://r4stats.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/fig_8_websitelinks.png?w=640&h=689).

If read this article you certainly get the sense that R is one of the top languages and trends all favor its continued growth while other popular software (SAS, SPSS, etc.) are seeing decline.

##Getting R and RStudio going
Over the last several years, RStudio has become a very popular IDE (integrated development environment) for R.  In addition to interacting with the R Console, RStudio has many extras built in including version control integration, package building, reproducible research, de-bugging, and built-in text editor with smart highlighting and code completion.  This is the environment we will be using for the two days and should set you up for continued learning with R.

##Exercise 1

1. Start RStudio: To start both R and RStudio requires only firing up RStudio.  RStudio should be available from All Programs at the Start Menu.  Fire up RStudio. You should have done this already (see [post 00](http://jwhollister.com/gedr/2015/01/14/00-Before-The-Workshop/)).

2. Take a few minutes to look around RStudio.  While you do this, I will demo a few things.

3. Make sure you can find the Console Pane, create a new project for Lesson 1, create a new file in the Source Pane, save that file into your newly created project. 

##Using functions
R is built off of functions and most of everything you do will use a function.

The basic syntax of function follows the form: `function_name(param1, param2, ...)`.  With the base install, you will gain access to many.  For instance:

```{r function_examples, cache=TRUE}
#Print
print("hello world!")
#A sequence
seq(1,10)
#Random normal numbers
rnorm(100,mean=10,sd=2)
#Mean
mean(rnorm(100))
```

##Using packages
The base install of R is quite powerful, but you will soon have a need or desire to go beyond this.  Packages provide this ability.  They are a standardized method for extending R with new methods, techniques, and programming functionality.  There is a lot to say about packages regarding finding them, using them, etc., but for now let's focus just on the basics.  

###CRAN
One of the reasons for R's popularity is CRAN, [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org/).  This is where you download R and also where most will gain access to packages (there are other places, but that is for later).  Not much else to say about this now other than to be aware or it.

###Installing packages
When a packages gets installed, that means the source (or packaged binary for Windows) is downloaded and put into your library.  A default library location is set for you so no need to worry about that.  In fact on Windows most of this is pretty automatic.  Let's give it a shot.


```{r install_package, cache=TRUE}
#Install dplyr and ggplot2
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")

#You can also put more than one in like
install.packages(c("randomForest","formatR"))
```

###Loading packages
One source of confusion that many have is when they cannot access a package that they just installed. This is because getting to this point requires an extra step, loading (or attaching) the package.   

```{r load_package, cache=TRUE}
#Add libraries to your R Session
library("ggplot2")
library("dplyr")

#You can also access functions in a library by using package::function
randomForest::randomForest

```

You will often see people use `require` to load a package. It is better form to not do this. For a more detailed explanation of why `library()` and not `require()` see [Yihui Xie's post on the subject](http://yihui.name/en/2014/07/library-vs-require/.)

###Some other useful commands
There are a lot of other commands that help you navigate packages

```{r other_packages, eval=FALSE}
#See what is installed
installed.packages()

#What packages are available?
available.packages()

#Update
update.packages()
```

##Help!
Being able to find help and interpret that help is probably one of the most important skills for learning a new language.  R is no different. Help on functions and packages can be accessed directly from R, can be found on CRAN and other official R resources, searched on Google, found on StackOverflow, or from any number of fantastic online resources. I will cover a few of these here. 

###Help from the console
Getting help from the console is straightforward and can be done numerous ways.

```{r help_from_console, eval=FALSE}
#Using the help command/shortcut
help("print") #Help on the print command
?print #Help on the print command using the `?` shortcut
help(package="dplyr") #Help on the package `dplyr`

#Don't know the exact name or just part of it
apropos("print") #Returns all available functions with "print" in the name
??print #Shortcut, but also searches demos and vignettes in a formatted page

```

###Official R Resources
In addition to help from with R itself, CRAN and the R-Project have many resources available for support.  Two of the most notable are the mailing lists and the task views.

- [R Help Mailing List](): The main mailing list for R help.  Can be a bit daunting and some senior folks can be, um, curmudgeonly...
- [R-sig-ecology](): A special interest group for use of R in ecology.  Less daunting the the main help with participation form some big names in ecological modelling (Ben Bolker and Gavin Simpson).  One of the moderators is great, the other is a bit of a jerk (it's me).
- [Environmetrics Task View](): Task views are great in that the provided an annotated list of packages relevant to a particular field.  This one is maitained by Gavin Simpson and has great info on packages relevant to much of the work at EPA.
- [Spatial Analysis Task View](): One I use a lot that lists all the relevant packages for spatial analysis, GIS, and Remote Sensing in R. 

###Google and StackOverflow
While the resources already mentioned are useful, often the quickest way is to just turn to Google.  However, a search for "R" is a bit challenging.  A few ways around this.  Google works great if you search of a given package.  You can search for mailing lists directly (i.e. "R-sig-geo").  An R specific search tool, [RSeek.org](http://www.rseek.org/), has been created to facilitate this.  

One specific resource that I use quite a bit is [StackOverflow with the 'r' tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r).  StackOverflow is a discussion forum for all things related to programming.  You can then use this tag and the search functions in StackOverflow and find answers to almost anything you can think of.

###Other Resources
As I mention earlier, there are TOO many resources to mention and everyone has their favorites.  Below are just a few that I like.

- [R For Cats](http://rforcats.net/): Basic introduction site, meant to be a gentle and light-hearted introduction
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/): Web home of Hadley Wickham's new book.  Gets into more advanced topics, but also covers the basics in a great way.
- [Why R is Hard To Learn](http://r4stats.com/articles/why-r-is-hard-to-learn/): Long and detailed blog post discussing some of the challenges people often face when learning R.
- [Other Resources](http://scicomp2014.edc.uri.edu/resources.html): A list I helped compile for a URI Class.
